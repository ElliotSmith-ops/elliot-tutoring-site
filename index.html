    <h2>About Elliot</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Elliot — a USC graduate in Computer Science & Business Administration, National Merit Scholar, and lifelong educator with a passion for helping kids grow into confident, curious, and capable people.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I’ve spent the last decade working with students in just about every setting you can imagine — classrooms, summer camps, tech labs, boats, beaches, and college prep seminars. I was the Youth Programs Director at the Center for Wooden Boats in Seattle, where I ran one of the most beloved and well-attended summer camps in the city. Before that, I led month-long teen expeditions, designed enrichment programs, and coached students through everything from algebra to executive function to finding their college voice.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My style blends structure with playfulness, empathy with accountability. I’ve been compared to Carl Sagan and Steve Irwin for the way I bring energy, clarity, and passion to subjects that might otherwise feel dry or intimidating. Whether it’s breaking down a tricky math concept, mapping out a study plan, or helping a student rediscover their love of learning, I aim to make every session meaningful — and maybe even a little fun.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Outside of tutoring, I’m a builder, writer, and lifelong learner myself. I love helping students explore coding, digital creativity, and emerging tech in ways that feel personal and relevant. I also coach students on how to tell their stories — whether through college applications, writing projects, or career exploration.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I work with students ages 8–18 who are bright, curious, struggling, neurodivergent, gifted, overwhelmed — or just looking for someone who “gets it.” My goal is simple: help each student feel seen, supported, and capable of more than they thought possible.

    <h2>Why Families Choose Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>I make learning feel human.</strong> I’ve run summer camps, led month-long expeditions, and taught thousands of students — I know how to build trust, spark curiosity, and make hard things feel possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>I bring both heart and rigor.</strong> I blend a camp director’s warmth with a top university graduate’s academic discipline. Sessions are structured, supportive, and never one-size-fits-all.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>I connect with kids where they are.</strong> Whether a student is thriving, struggling, or somewhere in between, I help them tap into their strengths and feel seen, capable, and confident again.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>I’ve been there — recently.</strong> I’ve navigated today’s college admissions, scholarships, and academic pressures firsthand. I help students and families focus on what actually matters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>I’m more than a tutor — I’m a mentor.</strong> My goal isn’t just better grades. It’s helping students grow into focused, self-aware, resilient young adults — and making the journey meaningful along the way.

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Q: What subjects do you tutor?</strong><br>
      A: I specialize in math, writing, executive function coaching, coding, and tech enrichment. I also help with science, history, and test prep as needed.</li>
  
      <li><strong>Q: Do you work with students who have ADHD or learning differences?</strong><br>
      A: Absolutely — many of my students are neurodivergent. I bring structure, patience, and strategies that meet them where they are and help them thrive.</li>
  
      <li><strong>Q: Can you help with college prep?</strong><br>
      A: Yes! I help students plan applications, develop compelling essays, and approach the process with clarity and authenticity. I’ve been through it recently and know what matters.</li>
  
      <li><strong>Q: What age range do you work with?</strong><br>
      A: I work with students ages 8–18. Each stage comes with its own challenges — and I tailor my approach to fit your student’s goals and personality.</li>
  
      <li><strong>Q: My child is smart but unmotivated. Can you help?</strong><br>
      A: This is actually one of my specialties. I help students reconnect with curiosity and confidence, especially those who are bored, burnt out, or unsure of their direction.</li>
  
      <li><strong>Q: How are sessions structured?</strong><br>
      A: Sessions are one-on-one and fully customized. Some students want academic coaching, others need help managing their workload — and some want to dive into coding or college essays. We focus on what will be most meaningful and helpful each week.</li>
  
      <li><strong>Q: Are sessions in-person or virtual?</strong><br>
      A: Both! I meet with students virtually via Zoom or in person around West LA (Brentwood, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, etc.). Most families choose virtual for convenience, but I love both formats.</li>
  
      <li><strong>Q: How often do you meet with students?</strong><br>
      A: Most students meet weekly or biweekly. I recommend weekly sessions for consistency and momentum, especially during the school year or application season.</li>
  
      <li><strong>Q: Do you assign homework?</strong><br>
      A: Only if it supports the student’s goals. Some students love challenges or project work between sessions, while others need space to manage existing school demands. We find the right balance together.</li>
  
      <li><strong>Q: How do we get started?</strong><br>
      A: Just email or text to set up a free 30-minute intro call. We’ll talk about your student’s needs, what you're hoping for, and how I can help.</li>
